If you are wanting to spice things up and add in a little flare to the shop, then you have to learn how to adapt and get creative! There are several magical items that will bring people banging on your door and ready to buy you out! </p>

       	<p>You can make cheesecakes that are the size of a muffin or a cupcake. They are about as popular as cookie sandwiches because everyone loves cheesecake and these are just the right size. They come in a variety of flavors but the most popular seems to be the original cheesecake and the strawberry. Bakers have the flexibility of putting out different flavors every day depending on what they feel like making. Despite what flavors are available, you will probably find that they sell out every day pretty quickly!</p>

Personal pies are about 4 inches in diameter so they are a little larger than a slice, but not too big! They can come in every pie flavor from chocolate to cherry or apple and satisfy all of your pie cravings without leaving you feeling overly stuffed.</p>

Some direct consumer responses highlight all these findings below: "Juicy, big, loaded with toppings of my choice."</p>

However, the results show that quick-service establishments aren’t the only places consumers go for a burger.

My feet didn’t move and confident grin on my face disappeared. I could tell that my four friends are also very scared. I’ve never been to this sweet shop before because I have heard from many people that Mrs. Pratchett is an ugly, unfriendly, mean and filthy old hag. I don’t think I would have wanted to visit her. My neighbors told me that she looks like a witch in a movie I had currently watched.</p>
